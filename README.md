# Elisa-3 remote obstacles avoidance
This is a terminal application implementing obstacles avoidance behavior controlling the robot from the compputer through the radio base-station, this means that the robot reacts only to the commands received from the computer and has no "intelligence" onboard. The demo uses the information gathered from the 3 front proximity sensors and set the motors speed accordingly; moreover the RGB LEDs are updated with a random color at fixed intervals. <br/>
The project depends on the [Elisa-3 remote library](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/Elisa-3#Elisa-3_library).<br/>
